# XeonCalc

## 📌 Overview
**XeonCalc** is a simple command-line calculator built with Python.  
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice core programming concepts such as conditional logic, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

Rather than focusing on complexity, XeonCalc emphasizes clarity, correctness, and readable code.
